# Bank_account_project
This is a bank account app.
In this repository I created a simple Python bank account app, in which you can create a currents or savings account. With those accounts you can simultaneously deposit and withdraw from both accounts. With the savings account the withdrawals go into the current account, and with the current account they go into your pocket :D. You can also count and add interest in your savings account.
